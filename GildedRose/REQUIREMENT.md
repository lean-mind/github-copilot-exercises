# New Requirement

We recently hired a supplier of magically conjured items. This requires an update to the system:

`Conjured` items degrade in quality twice as fast as `normal` items.

Feel free to modify the `UpdateQuality` method and add any necessary code, as long as everything continues to work
correctly. However, you must not modify the `Item` class or its properties, as it belongs to an elf who would strike you
down in a fit of rage because they do not believe in shared code culture.
