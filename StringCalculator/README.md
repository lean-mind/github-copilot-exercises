# Solving Bugs Reported by QA Team

In this exercise, you will solve the bugs reported by the QA team in the `add` function of the String Calculator.

These are edge cases that were not handled in the initial implementation of the `add` function.
You will need to fix the bugs using [The report of QA team](docs/bugs-reported-by-QA-team.md) as a guide.
